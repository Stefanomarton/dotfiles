We can help. At DuckDuckGo, we believe online privacy should be simple.\n\nDuckDuckGo Privacy Essentials comes packed with best-in-class privacy essentials and makes browsing in Firefox even faster.\n\nFEATURE HIGHLIGHTS:\n\n    Search Privately — our private search engine comes built-in so you can search the Internet without being tracked.\n    Escape Website Tracking — block most hidden 3rd-party trackers found lurking on websites you visit by preventing tracking scripts from loading. This is an effective way to keep companies behind these trackers from collecting and selling your data. See notes and links below for more information.\n    Enforce Encryption — force many sites you visit to use an encrypted (HTTPS) connection where available, protecting your data from prying eyes.\n    Block Email Trackers (Beta) — 70% of emails track you as soon as you open them. Enabling our Email Protection is the easy way to block most email trackers and hide your address without switching email services. Join the private waitlist for the free beta version through our mobile app settings menu.\n    Signal Your Privacy Preference with GPC — built into the app, Global Privacy Control (GPC) intends to help you express your opt-out rights automatically by telling websites not to sell or share your personal information. Whether it can be used to enforce your legal rights (for example, current or future CCPA, GDPR requirements) depends on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\n\nPLUS EVEN MORE PROTECTION FROM: \n\n    Fingerprinting — helps stop companies from trying to combine specific information about your browser and device settings to create a unique identifier for you that they can use to follow you around the web.\n    Link Tracking — helps stop websites from gathering your browsing history and personal identifiers from links you click on. \n    Social Trackers — block a lot of embedded social content around the web so companies like Facebook can't track you through their videos, posts, and comments found on other sites. You can easily unblock to view them if desired. \n    Google AMP — force sites to load content directly from publishers instead of using Google-owned links, which are full of creepy trackers.\n    Unexpected Cookies — prevent most 3rd-party tracking cookies from tracking you as you browse from site to site.\n\n\nYou don't need to wait to take back your privacy. Join the millions of people using DuckDuckGo and protect many of your everyday online activities. It's privacy, simplified.    \n\nNote about our tracker blocking for 3rd-party sites and emails: \nDuckDuckGo never tracks you. When you leave our search engine to use other sites, we aim to block as many hidden trackers as possible, but we can't block them all for a few reasons. New trackers emerge all the time, so first we need to find them. Then, blocking these trackers can sometimes break functionality, so we need to develop new approaches without hurting usability. Additionally, in our extension we offer a specific type of protection that stops scripts from even loading on 3rd-party sites, which isn’t offered on most popular browsers by default. Currently, this one loading protection doesn't apply to Microsoft scripts on 3rd-party sites due to contractual restrictions. However, our other tracker blocking methods (like 3rd-party cookie blocking) are unrestricted and continue to work against these trackers to protect your privacy online. \n\nMORE ABOUT OUR TECHNOLOGY:\nTracker Radar: https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-tracker-radar/ \nSmarter Encryption: https://spreadprivacy.com/duckduckgo-smarter-encryption/ \nEmail Protection: https://spreadprivacy.com/introducing-email-protection-beta/ \nGPC: https://spreadprivacy.com/announcing-global-privacy-control/ \n \nLooking for our Mac browsing app?

Replace Firefox's control mechanism with one modelled on Vim.\n\nThis addon is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator's features.","fullDescription":"Control your browser with your keyboard only.\nReplace Firefox’s control mechanism with one modelled on VIM. This is a “Firefox Quantum” replacement for VimFX, Vimperator and Pentadactyl. Most common tasks you want your browser to perform are bound to a single key press:\n\n    You want to open a new tab? Hit t.\n    You want to follow that link? Hit f and type the displayed label. (Note: hint characters should be typed in lowercase.)\n    You want to go to the bottom of the page? Hit G. Or the top? gg.\n    You want to focus the text field on Wikipedia to search for another term? gi.\n    Switch to the next tab? gt.\n    Go back in time? H.\n    Notice that this tab is rubbish and you want to close it? d.\n    Regret that decision? u restores it.\n    Want to write something in Vim? Ctrl-i in a text box opens it in Vim, if you have :native working.\n    Temporarily disable all that magic because you can’t stand it? Shift-Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape.\n    But how do you use your browser now? Shift-Insert or Ctrl-Alt-Escape again and we’re back on.\n\nThe list could go on a bit here, but I guess you’ll get the point. If you feel lost sometimes :help might help you a lot, and there’s always :tutor.\nHighlighted features:\n\n    Follow any link on the site with just 2-3 key presses.\n    Switch to any open tab by searching for its URL or title or entering its ID.\n    Easy customizable search settings.\n    Bind any supported command or commands to the key (sequence) of your liking.\n    Great default bindings (if you’re used to Pentadactyl or Vimperator).\n\nThis add-on is very usable, but is in an early stage of development. We intend to implement the majority of Vimperator’s features.\nYou can get beta builds from our website.\nPermissions:\nSince Tridactyl aims to provide all the features Vimperator and Pentadactyl had, it requires quite a few permissions. Here we describe the specific permissions and why we need them.\n\n    Access your data for all websites:\n        This is Mozilla’s way of saying that Tridactyl can read the content of web pages. This is necessary in order to e.g. find the links you can follow with the :hint command (bound to f by default).\n    Exchange messages with programs other than Firefox:\n        This permission is required for Tridactyl to interact with your operating system (opening your editor to edit text areas, sending links to your video player, reading a configuration file from your disk…). This is possible thanks to an external executable we provide. If you feel this gives Tridactyl too much power you can chose not to install the external executable: Tridactyl will still work but won’t be able to start external programs.\n    Read and modify bookmarks:\n        Tridactyl’s command line has a powerful autocompletion mechanism. In order to be able to autocomplete your bookmarks, Tridactyl needs to read them.\n    Clear recent browsing history, cookies, and related data:\n        Tridactyl implements the :sanitise command Vimperator and Pentadactyl had. It works a bit like the “Clear All History” dialog you can access by pressing Ctrl+Shift+Del on default Firefox.\n    Get data from the clipboard:\n        If your clipboard contains a URL, pressing p will make Tridactyl follow this URL in the current tab.\n    Input data to the clipboard:\n        Tridactyl lets you copy various elements to the clipboard such as a page’s URL with yy, a link’s URL with ;y or the content of an HTML element with ;p.\n    Download files and read and modify the browser’s download history:\n        By pressing ;s, ;S, ;a and ;A you can save documents and pictures from a page to your download folder.\n    Access browsing history:\n        The URLs of websites you’ve visited previously can be suggested as arguments for :tabopen and similar commands.\n    Access recently closed tabs:\n        If you’ve accidentally closed a tab or window, Tridactyl will let you open it again with the :undo command which is bound to u by default.\n    Access browser tabs:\n        Tridactyl provides a quick tab-switching menu/command with the :buffer command (bound to b). This permission is also required to close, move, and pin tabs, amongst other things.\n    Access browser activity during navigation:\n        This is needed for Tridactyl to be able to go back to normal mode every time you open a new page. In the future we may use it for autocommands.\n    Read the text of all open tabs:\n        This allows us to use Firefox’s built-in find-in-page API, for, for example, allowing you to bind find-next and find-previous to n and N.\n    Monitor extension usage and manage themes:\n        Tridactyl needs this to integrate with and avoid conflicts with other extensions. For example, Tridactyl’s contextual identity features use this to cooperate with the Multi-Account Containers extension.","screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/202/202002.png?modified=1622132820","width":2400,"height":1350,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/202/202002.jpg?modified=1622132820","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":300},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/193/193704.png?modified=1622132820","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193704.jpg?modified=1622132820","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":293},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/193/193703.png?modified=1622132820","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193703.jpg?modified=1622132820","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":293},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/193/193705.png?modified=1622132821","width":700,"height":385,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/193/193705.jpg?modified=1622132821","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":293},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/191/191470.png?modified=1622132821","width":700,"height":384,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/191/191470.jpg?modified=1622132821","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":292}],"homepageURL":"https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl","supportURL":"https://github.com/cmcaine/tridactyl/issues","contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.864,"reviewCount":174,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tridactyl-vim/reviews/","weeklyDownloads":196,"sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3926466/tridactyl_vim-1.22.1.xpi","updateDate":1648048308000},{"id":"{eac6e624-97fa-4f28-9d24-c06c9b8aa713}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2681/2681640-32.png?modified=4de4a554","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2681/2681640-64.png?modified=4de4a554","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/2681/2681640-128.png?modified=4de4a554"},"type":"extension","name":"Material Icons for Github","version":"1.6.2","creator":{"name":"Claudio Santos","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/16591378/"},"developers":[],"description":"Replace the file/folder icons on github file browsers with icons representing the file's type and which tool it is used by.","fullDescription":"Replace GitHub's default icons with icons from Visual Studio Code's Material Icon Theme icons.
